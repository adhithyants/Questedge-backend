                "id": 1,
                "text": "If all cats are mammals and some mammals are black, which of the following is true?",
                "options": [
                    {"text": "All cats are black", "correct": false},

                    {"text": "Some mammals are not cats", "correct": false}
                ],
                "explanation": "Some mammals are black, and since all cats are mammals, it is possible that some cats are black. However, it is not guaranteed that all or no cats are black, and the statement about mammals not being cats is not directly supported."

                ],
                "explanation": "The sequence follows a pattern where each number is multiplied by 2: 2 × 2 = 4, 4 × 2 = 8, 8 × 2 = 16. Thus, 16 × 2 = 32 is the next number."

                "explanation": "Ten days is one full week (7 days) plus 3 days. One week from Wednesday is still Wednesday, and adding 3 more days (Thursday, Friday, Monday) results in Tuesday."

                "explanation": "Small, tall, and short are all adjectives describing size with specific opposites (small/short vs. tall). Big is a more general size adjective and does not fit the specific height-related pattern."
