                ],
                "explanation": "In a 90-degree clockwise rotation, the top-left corner moves to the top-right, the top-right to the bottom-right, and so on. Thus, the original top-right corner is now in the top-left position."

                "explanation": "In a standard cube, the face opposite the top (face 1) is the bottom. If faces are numbered 1 to 6, the opposite of face 1 is face 6, so face 6 is on the bottom."
